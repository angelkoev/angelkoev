### Hi ðŸ‘‹

## I'm (obviously) interested in programming and software development.

# I finish studying for Java Web Developer at @SoftUni.

# Now I continue my education through other courses.

##### I know that repositories are mess, but I decide that it is better to learn new things and obtain new skills, rather than making everything looks "perfect"
